Project 

Development Phases
1. Requirements and Planning:
Define the rules and game logic.
Determine the features (chat, score tracking, AI opponent, etc.).
Plan the architecture and select the technologies.
2. Backend Development:
Game Logic: Implement the Rock-Paper-Scissors rules and gameplay mechanics.
Player Management: Handle player connections, lobby management, and game state.
Networking: Implement real-time communication between players using WebSockets.
Optional AI Opponent: Create a simple AI using decision trees or other basic algorithms if you want an AI bot feature.
Tools and Technologies:

Programming Languages: Python, Node.js, Java, etc.
WebSockets for real-time communication.
Database (if required): MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.
3. Frontend Development:
User Interface (UI): Design and develop the UI for the lobby, game screen, and other elements.
Game Interaction: Implement the interaction logic for player actions.
Real-Time Updates: Handle real-time updates between players.
Tools and Technologies:

Frameworks: React, Angular, Vue.js, etc.
CSS libraries: Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, etc.
4. Cloud Environment and Deployment:
Containerization: Dockerize the application for consistent deployment.
Orchestration: Use Kubernetes or Docker Compose for orchestration.
Cloud Deployment: Deploy to a cloud provider of your choice.
Tools and Technologies:

Docker, Kubernetes
Cloud Providers: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc.
5. Monitoring and Security:
Implement monitoring using Prometheus or similar tools.
Apply security measures, such as input validation, HTTPS, etc.
6. Testing and Quality Assurance:
Write unit tests and integration tests.
Perform manual testing to ensure all features work as expected.
Documentation
Create comprehensive documentation detailing how to play the game, how to set up the environment, and an overview of the architecture.
Future Enhancements
Implement additional features like player profiles, leaderboards, or more advanced AI opponents.
This project is multifaceted and requires a mix of skills in backend and frontend development, networking, possibly AI, and DevOps. It's a great way to demonstrate your abilities as a developer and will be a valuable addition to your GitHub repository. Happy coding!
